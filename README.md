First thing I would recommendation I have is to install pi apps with this command
<p>command: wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Botspot/pi-apps/master/install | bash ; pi-apps</p>
This is the best place to get apps on arm based chromebooks because almost all apps work(you can install steam with this)</p>
<p>While you can get steam on an ARM based I would not recommend it unless you have more than 4GB of RAM</p>
<p>I would also recommed that you get KDE plasme, this is great for people with 4GB of RAM or more.</p>
<p>Command: sudo apt instal plasma-desktop</p>
<p>You can change your desktop with the little white circle, if you have installed KDE plasma then select plasma(wayland)</p>
